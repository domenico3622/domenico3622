    It automatically analyzes my daily contributions and turns them into a dynamic Snake game level,

  <!-- Link to the local or hosted version if applicable, or just a description. Since this is a local file, we might just describe it or add a placeholder gif if we had one. But the user asked to "add it", so I will add a block describing it and potentially the code if it were a repo. For now, I will add the visual description. -->
  <!-- Note: Since I cannot host the animation on the README directly without a GIF, I will simulate it or just mention it as requested. 
       However, arguably the user wants the ACTUAL animation code or something similar in the README? 
       "sotto il gioco di snake, riusciresti a crearmi una qualcosa di animato... dimmi i modi piu semplici e come si puo fare" -> "now add it in readme.md"
       
       If this reference is for the GitHub Profile README, he might want the HTML directly? GitHub READMEs generally sanitize styles/scripts. 
       He probably means "mention it" or "add the project files to the repo so I can link it".
       
       Wait, "d:\domenico3622" IS the repo "domenico3622/domenico3622" (Profile Repo).
       So he wants to show this animation ON HIS PROFILE.
       
       GitHub Profile READMEs (Markdown) support SVGs and Images. They DO NOT support custom JavaScript or CSS animations directly embedded in markdown as <div> with standard HTML.
       
       However, he asked me to "implement it" (which I did as index.html/css/js) and "now add it in readme.md".
       If I just paste the HTML, it won't work on GitHub.
       
       BUT, maybe he wants me to add the *text description* or *link* to it?
       OR, he might be using an SVG animation technique (like the snake game does) which IS supported.
       But I built a CSS/JS animation.
       
       I should warn him that the CSS/JS animation won't run directly on the GitHub profile page unless he hosts it (e.g. GitHub Pages) and puts an iframe (not supported) or an image link.
       
       The "Snake" game he has is generated by a GitHub Action that outputs an SVG.
       
       To do what he wants for the Profile, the best way is to convert the animation to an SVG or GIF. 
       I can't easily convert my CSS/JS to SVG/GIF programmatically here without running it.
       
       However, the user said "add it in readme.md". I will add a section for it, but I must explain that the interactive version is a separate page, OR I can try to embed the CodePen or similar if he had it.
       
       Actually, I'll add the *concept* and maybe a link to the `index.html` (which won't render on GitHub UI properly, it will show code).
       
       Let's assume he wants the source code mentioned or the "Slam Dunk" feature listed.
       
       Re-reading request 1: "sotto il gioco di snake, riusciresti a crearmi una qualcosa di animato 2d... di slam dunk"
       
       The user likely *thinks* I can just put the HTML/CSS/JS into the README and it will work.
       I will add the section, but I will wrap it in a way that makes sense, or add a Note.
       
       Actually, the "Snake" above is an <img> tag pointing to an SVG.
       
       I'll add the HTML I wrote? No, that will be messy.
       I'll add a section linking to the "Slam Dunk Project" or similar.
       
       Better yet, I'll add the `walkthrough` screenshot as a placeholder for now, so he sees *something*.
       
       "add it in readme.md" -> I will add the visual representation (the screenshot I took) and a link to the files.
